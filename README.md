# Pachinko
A simple project for testing some SpriteKit basic functionality 

## Description
This project is a simple and basic project that I'm using to learn some basic functionality of SpriteKit, Apple's main 2D game framework.

## How to use 
To use this project, you just need to download or clone this repository, execute the project on Xcode, and run either on the iPad simulator, or a real iPad device.

## Notes
This project, by no means, aims to be a guide of how to structure the code, here, I just want to try some new functionality, and, as you can see on the gameScene.swift file, the majority of the code happens on the "didMove(to view:)" method, which is not optimal for design.
